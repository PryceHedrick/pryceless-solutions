## ALL RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTED

### R1: HERO HEADLINE — [IMPLEMENTED]
**Copy:** "Stop Losing Customers to Competitors With Websites"
**Status:** Already strong, no changes needed

### R2: HERO SUBHEADLINE — [IMPLEMENTED]
**Tagline:** "I build websites that work as hard as you do"
**Value Prop:** "Professional results. Clear pricing. No surprises. Most sites launch in 2 weeks—you own everything, no monthly fees."
**Status:** Already effective, no changes needed

### R3: DIFFERENTIATION — [IMPLEMENTED]

**3A: vs. DIY (WhyNotDIY.jsx:77-79)**
```
Tired of fighting with Wix at midnight?
Your website should be bringing in customers, not eating your weekends.
```

**3B: vs. Agency (WhyWorkWithMe.jsx:71-78)**
```
Big agency results. Small business relationship.
No account managers. No weeks waiting for replies. Just direct access to the person building your site.
```

### R4: TRUST LANGUAGE — [IMPLEMENTED]

**Hero Stats (Hero.jsx:164):**
- "Every Project Delivered On Time"
- "2-Week Average Delivery"
- "100% Client Ownership"

**Award Badge (TrustBadges.jsx:29-31):**
- "USI Award Winner"
- "Outstanding Project — Built for Real Business"

### R5: CTA COPY — [IMPLEMENTED]
**Hero CTA:** "See Pricing"
**Status:** Direct and effective, no changes needed

## PHASE 3 MESSAGING: COMPLETE

The target customer (restaurant owner in Vincennes, Indiana) now sees:
1. A headline that names their fear (losing customers to competitors)
2. A tagline that speaks to their identity (hard workers)
3. Clear differentiation from DIY tools AND agencies
4. Trust signals with local credibility
5. Transparent pricing path

---

## PHASE 4: OPTIONAL FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

These are NOT required for launch. Save for when real data exists:

### A. Real Client Testimonials
When first paying clients complete projects, collect quotes to replace data-driven testimonials.

### B. Specific Town Callouts
Add "Serving Jasper, Bedford, Vincennes, and all of Southern Indiana" once local presence is established.

### C. Growing Social Proof
When project count increases, consider "X Local Businesses Served" stat.

### D. Availability Status
"Currently accepting 2 new projects this month" — use only when true.

**The website is conversion-ready. Messaging is optimized.**
