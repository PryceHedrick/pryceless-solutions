## Key Deliverables

### Specific Copy Produced

**vs. DIY Positioning:**
```
Tired of fighting with Wix at midnight?
Your website should be bringing in customers, not eating your weekends.
```

**vs. Agency Positioning:**
```
Big agency results. Small business relationship.
No account managers. No weeks waiting for replies. Just direct access to the person building your site.
```

**Trust Stat Options:**
- Option A: "Every Project Delivered On Time"
- Option B: "12 Local Businesses Served"

**Award Badge Refinement:**
- "USI Award Winner" / "Outstanding Project — Built for Real Business"

## What Primary Should Implement

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. Add vs. DIY copy to CostComparison.jsx
2. Choose and implement Hero stats option

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
3. Add vs. Agency copy
4. Update TrustBadges award copy

### NO ACTION NEEDED
- Hero headline (already strong)
- Tagline/value prop (already effective)
- CostComparison heading (already clear)

## Blockers
None

## Files for Primary to Modify
- src/components/Hero.jsx (stats update)
- src/components/CostComparison.jsx (positioning copy)
- src/components/TrustBadges.jsx (award copy)
- src/components/WhyWorkWithMe.jsx (optional titles)

## Strategic Insight Summary
The Phase 2 work was MORE EFFECTIVE than initially assessed. The messaging foundation is solid. Phase 3 should focus on adding 2-3 emotional positioning statements, not wholesale rewrites.

## Shadow Agent Conclusion
All 5 recommendations are READY for Primary implementation.
The target customer (restaurant owner in Vincennes) will now have:
- Clear understanding of who this is for
- Answers to "DIY vs. professional" doubt
- Answers to "agency vs. freelancer" doubt
- Trust signals that establish local credibility

**SHADOW STRATEGY MISSION: COMPLETE**
