## Your Facebook Page Isn't Enough Anymore

I talk to small business owners in Southern Indiana every week who say, "I have a Facebook page - isn't that enough?"

The short answer: No. Here's why.

### The Numbers Don't Lie

- **97%** of consumers search online for local businesses
- **75%** judge a company's credibility by their website
- **88%** won't return to a site after a bad experience
- **53%** of mobile users abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load

### What You're Losing Without a Website

#### 1. Customers Who Search Google

When someone searches "plumber near me" or "best restaurant in Bedford," they're finding your competitors - not you. Facebook pages rarely rank in Google search results.

#### 2. Credibility and Trust

A professional website signals that you're a legitimate, established business. When customers compare you to competitors with websites, you're at an immediate disadvantage.

#### 3. Control Over Your Brand

On Facebook, you're at the mercy of algorithm changes. They can limit your reach, change policies, or even delete your page. Your website is yours forever.

#### 4. Lead Capture

Without a website, you can't:
- Collect email addresses
- Offer downloadable resources
- Run effective Google Ads
- Track customer behavior

### "But I Don't Have the Budget"

I hear this a lot. But consider:

- A basic website costs $750-1,800 one-time
- That's less than most businesses spend on one month of advertising
- A website works for you 24/7/365
- ROI: Just 2-3 new customers covers the cost

### "I'm Not Tech-Savvy"

You don't need to be. That's our job. We handle everything:
- Design and development
- Hosting setup
- Domain configuration
- Ongoing support

You just tell us about your business.

### Real Results from Real Indiana Businesses

When local businesses launch websites, they typically see:
- 30-50% increase in phone calls
- Better quality leads
- Higher closing rates
- Improved customer trust

When someone's hungry and searching for a place to eat, you have about 3 seconds to impress them. Here are the 7 features that turn website visitors into paying customers.

### 1. Mobile-First Menu Display

**Why it matters:** 70% of restaurant searches happen on mobile devices. If your menu is a PDF that's hard to read on phones, you're losing customers.

**What you need:**
- Text-based menu (not just a PDF image)
- Easy-to-read on all devices
- Quick load times
- Organized by category
- Prices clearly visible

### 2. Location and Hours Front and Center

**The #1 frustration:** Customers can't find basic info quickly.

**Include:**
- Address with Google Maps integration
- Current hours (update for holidays!)
- Phone number (click-to-call on mobile)
- Parking information

### 3. High-Quality Food Photography

**The truth:** People eat with their eyes first.

**Tips:**
- Use natural lighting
- Show your best dishes
- Keep images updated
- Compress for fast loading

### 4. Online Ordering or Reservation System

**Options to consider:**
- Direct online ordering (keep 100% of revenue)
- Third-party integration (DoorDash, UberEats)
- Table reservation system
- Call-to-action buttons throughout

### 5. Customer Reviews and Social Proof

**What builds trust:**
- Google review integration
- Yelp ratings display
- Customer testimonials
- Awards and recognition

### 6. About Us Story

**Why it matters:** People connect with stories, not businesses.

**Include:**
- Your history and journey
- Chef/owner background
- What makes you unique
- Community involvement

### 7. Fast Loading Speed

**Critical stat:** 53% of visitors leave if your site takes more than 3 seconds to load.

**How we achieve this:**
- Optimized images
- Clean code
- Fast hosting
- No bloated plugins

### Bonus: Local SEO Optimization

To rank for "restaurants near me" searches:
- Claim Google Business Profile
- Consistent name/address/phone across web
